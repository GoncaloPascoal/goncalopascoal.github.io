### 1. Setup and Modding

<p class="note">
<strong>Note</strong><br>
This section contains some information about how I got the game working on Windows 10, as well as about the mods I used in order to improve the play experience. If this doesn't interest you, you can skip it.

Since Arena was released for MS-DOS, an emulator is required in order to run the game on a modern operating system. There is an ongoing open-source project called **OpenTESArena**, which *"aims to be a modern engine re-implementation"* of Arena, as per its [GitHub page](https://github.com/afritz1/OpenTESArena). However, as it's still in development, I emulated the game through [DosBox](https://www.dosbox.com/). The game has been available free of charge on [Bethesda's website](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/arena/) since 2004, the tenth anniversary of the Elder Scrolls series.

A few DosBox config tweaks were required; I mostly followed the recommendations present in this [PCGamingWiki page](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls:_Arena). 

Only a few dozen mods are available for Arena, judging by its [NexusMods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/tesarena), and I only used the following 4 during my playthrough:

* [TES Arena Remapped](https://www.nexusmods.com/tesarena/mods/1) – modernizes Arena's archaic controls (for example, using WASD to move about instead of the arrow keys). In my opinion, this is absolutely essential.
* [TES Arena ReFonted](https://www.nexusmods.com/tesarena/mods/5) – replaces some of the game's fonts with simpler variants. This does eliminate some of the fantasy flair of the fonts, however, since they are displayed in such a low resolution, that is a sacrifice I am willing to make in favor of readability.
* [OpeningFix](https://www.nexusmods.com/tesarena/mods/13) – fixes a couple of errors in the game's opening text.
* [Sound Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/tesarena/mods/15) – removes the clicking and popping noises that are present in a lot of the game's sounds. Highly recommended if you value your hearing.

### 4. Sound

One of Arena's limitations is the fact that it can only play one sound effect at a time. This means that while the sound of your footsteps is playing, sounds of any nearby enemies or doors opening will be completely absent. This exacerbates the issue of enemies appearing directly behind you, since you lack the necessary auditory clues to quickly react to the situation. Often, you only realize that you are being attacked after sustaining damage, which causes your screen to shake, and you may sustain two or three other hits as you turn around to deal with the threat, which can lead to instant death against some enemies, especially when playing a character with fewer hitpoints.

Despite considering this one of the most frustrating things about the game, it is understandable given the technical limitations at the time. Still, I wonder if some of that frustration could have been avoided had the footstep sound been removed from the game, therefore prioritizing the most important sounds.

The soundtrack is suited to the high fantasy theme, the tunes for the towns are inspiring, whereas the dungeon themes function more as eerie and unsettling ambience. Each type of building (inns, temples, palaces, equipment stores) in the towns also has its own theme, and the music changes according to the seasons, the weather and time of day (my favorite is daytime snowy).
