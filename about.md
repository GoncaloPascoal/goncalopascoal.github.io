My name is Gonçalo. 
I'm Portuguese and currently studying for a Master's Degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_base.gera_pagina?p_pagina=boas%20vindas).

I'm also a hobbyist game developer. You can find my games on my [itch.io page](https://venompaco.itch.io/). 
Currently I have only published two games, both developed during game jams. You can also find game dev related videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvL53_aSBTpDE0RN1dp6WkA). 
I am also interested in game design and video games as an art form, and I'm planning on creating videos discussing those topics.

As for other hobbies, I enjoy playing all kinds of videogames (though I especially enjoy RPGs, stealth games and [immersive sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_sim)), reading (mostly fantasy and science fiction), drawing and writing. 
I also like playing Magic: The Gathering from time to time (my favourite colour is Black).

Additionally, I play the guitar, know a bit of piano and accordion and I'm currently learning the mandolin.
