My name is Gonçalo.
I'm Portuguese and hold a Master's Degree in **Informatics and Computing Engineering** from [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_base.gera_pagina?p_pagina=boas%20vindas). I am currently working as a **Full-Stack Software Developer** at [Vestas](https://www.vestas.com/), developing a web-based application for structural analysis and design of wind turbine towers.
I am particularly interested in the design of algorithms and data structures, the challenges associated with distributed systems and performance-critical software, and low-level / systems programming.

My Master's thesis, <a href="https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/153420/3/646720.pdf" target="_blank">Noise-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Strategies for Qubit Routing</a> leveraged deep reinforcement learning (specifically Proximal Policy Optimization) to compile quantum algorithms more efficiently for realistic architectures, in an effort to mitigate the adverse effects of noise on the outcome of computations. In particular, it tackled the NP-complete qubit routing problem, which arises due to the limited connectivity between qubits in many quantum computers. To ensure that a program adheres to these constraints, auxiliary operations must be inserted, and finding the optimal way to do so using the fewest additional operations is a challenging optimization problem. I have also published a [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10646540) based on work conducted during and after my M.Sc. thesis, which was presented at the [2024 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Software](https://qsw.conferences.computer.org/2024/).

I am also a hobbyist game developer. You can find my games on my [itch.io page](https://venompaco.itch.io/). 
Currently, I have published three games developed during game jams and two games developed as projects for a university course. You can also find game dev related videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvL53_aSBTpDE0RN1dp6WkA). 
I am also interested in game design and video games as an art form.

As for other hobbies, I enjoy playing all kinds of videogames (though I especially enjoy RPGs, stealth games and [immersive sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_sim)), reading (mostly fantasy and science fiction), drawing and writing. 
I also like playing Magic: The Gathering from time to time (my favourite colour is Black).

Music also one of my passions. I mostly play the guitar and mandolin, and know a bit of piano and accordion.
